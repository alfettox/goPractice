# Custom File Implementation

This Go program demonstrates the implementation of a custom file-like structure called `CustomFile`. It offers basic file operations, including reading, writing, seeking, and providing file information.

## Program Overview

1. **CustomFile Structure**: The program defines a `CustomFile` structure that mimics a simplified file with an underlying data array. It provides methods for various file operations.

2. **File Operations**:
   - **Read**: Reads data from the file starting from the current position.
   - **Write**: Appends data to the file.
   - **Seek**: Allows seeking within the file, supporting different seek modes.
   - **Readdir**: Placeholder method for listing directory contents (can be customized).
   - **Stat**: Retrieves file information such as name, size, mode, and modification time.

3. **File Information**: The program defines a custom `os.FileInfo` implementation (`customFileInfo`) to provide file information. The modification time is returned using the current time, but you can customize it as needed.

## How to Use the Program

1. The `main` function demonstrates the use of the `CustomFile` structure. It performs read, write, seek, and file information retrieval operations.

2. Customize the `Readdir` method and `Stat` method to suit your specific use case. The example provided serves as a starting point for more comprehensive file operations.
